# api/instructions.ai
# Responsibility: Contains FastAPI route definitions, request/response models, and API logic for the server.

# FastAPI Route Definitions:
#
# 1. simulation_creator_api.py:
#    - POST /create-simulations: Accepts a list of SimulationRequest objects, creates simulations, and returns their IDs.
#    - POST /send-simulation-message: Accepts a SimulationRequest, creates and publishes a simulation, and returns its ID.
#    - POST /send-link-message: Accepts a LinkBusMessage, publishes a link message, and returns a confirmation string.
#    - GET /ping: Health check endpoint for the creator API.
#
# 2. simulation_management_api.py:
#    - GET /ping: Health check endpoint for the management API.
#
# Request/Response Models:
#
# - SimulationRequest: Contains a Topology and optional Config for simulation creation.
# - LinkBusMessage: Contains a simulation ID and a Link object.
# - Topology: List of nodes and links (connections between nodes).
# - Config: Simulation configuration (duration, packet loss, log level).
#
# API Logic:
#
# - Uses SimulationMapper to convert requests to Simulation objects.
# - Uses SimulationBusinessLogic to handle simulation creation, storage, and publishing via RabbitMQ.
# - Uses LinksPublisher to publish link messages to RabbitMQ.
# - Logging is performed for each route and operation.
#
# Note: Placeholder endpoints and future extension points (e.g., authentication, additional models) are present in the code.
