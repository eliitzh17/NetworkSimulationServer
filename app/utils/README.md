# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility modules that provide supporting functionality for the Network Simulation Server. These utilities help with logging, error handling, system information, time conversions, object normalization, and message queue management.

## File Overview

- **system_info.py**
  - Provides utilities to retrieve system and network information, such as machine ID, hostname, IP address, and available network interfaces.

- **logger.py**
  - Implements a thread-safe logging system using Loguru, including a base logger interface and a logger manager for consistent logging across the application.

- **error_handler.py**
  - Contains decorators for standardized exception handling and transactional database operations, ensuring robust error management and atomicity.

- **object_utils.py**
  - Utilities for normalizing and fingerprinting network topology objects, enabling consistent comparison and hashing of topologies.

- **time_utils.py**
  - Simple utilities for converting between milliseconds and seconds.

## Notes
- The `__pycache__` directory is auto-generated by Python and contains compiled bytecode; it is not relevant for development or documentation.
